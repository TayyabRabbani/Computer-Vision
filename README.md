## üöÄ Technologies & Libraries Used

This repository primarily utilizes the following technologies and libraries for computer vision tasks:

* **Python:** The primary programming language for all projects.
* **OpenCV:** For traditional image processing, feature detection, object tracking, and basic computer vision operations.
* **TensorFlow / Keras:** For building and training deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For data visualization and plotting results.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms, if used in conjunction with vision tasks.
* **Mediapipe** For Hand Tracking projects
