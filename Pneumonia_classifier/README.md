# GoogLeNet Paper Implementation

This project implements the GoogLeNet (Inception v1) architecture inspired by the original research paper: *"Going Deeper with Convolutions"*.

## Objective
Reproduce the GoogLeNet architecture in TensorFlow/Keras to understand the inception module design and deep network construction.

## Files
- `googlenet-paper.ipynb`: Implementation of the GoogLeNet model architecture with discussion and tests
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook googlenet-paper.ipynb
```
